# SCAD

A simple SCAD Generator, allowing programmable 3D design from Perl.  This tool allows easy generation of
OpenSCAD scripts that can be used to generate 3D Objects, in a fairly Perlish way. It is curretly working
its way through the tutorial and will hopefully have an incremental features that allow complex models to
be generated and produce files that can fed into a 3D printer.
